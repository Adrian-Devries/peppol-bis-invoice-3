= Cross Industry Invoice

This {peppol} BIS supports the *optional* use of the UN/CEFACT XML Cross Industry Invoice,D16B (CII).

All invoice instances expressed in CII must be compliant to the restrictions and rules made by this BIS, and hence a CII instance document, must be validated against the PEPPOL specific rules, just as the UBL instance documents.

CustomizationID and profileID are the same in a CII instance as for the UBL instance, see <<prof-01>>

The CII validation rules can be found #here#.
