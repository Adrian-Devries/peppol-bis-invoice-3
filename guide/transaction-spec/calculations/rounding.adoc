= Rounding


To minimize the risk of differences due to rounding, the following rules apply:

* All document level totals shall be rounded to two decimals for accounting
* Rounding shall be done on the final calculation results not on any intermediate results
* VAT category tax amount (BT-117) shall be rounded on document level and not as a summation of rounded Invoice line VAT amounts
* Results from calculations involving already rounded amounts are not subject to rounding, like payable amounts and total amounts included VAT.
