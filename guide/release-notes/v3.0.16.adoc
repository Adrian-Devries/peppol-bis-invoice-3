== Changes to BIS document


== Changes to code lists and validation artefacts

* The validation rule identified as PEPPOL-EN16931-R006, which ensures that only one Invoice Object is allowed at the document level in an invoice/credit note, has been removed. This is because it duplicates the European standard rule UBL-SR-04, making it redundant and unnecessary.

* The structure of the Peppol Schematron rule set has been improved for better quality. A function that was previously located in the Greek rules section is now correctly positioned alongside other functions.

==  Changes to Country-Specific Rules
