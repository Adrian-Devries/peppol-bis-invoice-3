The electronic transaction message described in this implementation guide is the Invoice and credit note messages. The
Creditor/Invoice Issuer sends the Invoice or Credit note message to the Debtor/Invoicee, indicating the products, quantities,
and agreed prices for products and/or services the seller has provided the buyer.
The BIS mandates no procurement related data but supports different ways of referring to the ordering process.
By selective use of such references, they can be a basis for automated processing of invoices.


Accounting::
Booking an invoice/credit note into the company account is one of the main objectives of this profile. An
invoice/credit note must provide for information at document and line level that enables booking both the
debit and the credit side.

Auditing::
Invoices/credit notes support the auditing process by providing sufficient information for the following
* Identification of the relevant parties.
* Identification of the product and/or services traded, including description, value and quantity.
* Information for connecting the invoice/credit note to its settlement.
* Information for connecting the invoice/credit note to relevant documents such as contracts and orders.
* For Credit notes, identification of the initial invoice(s) and description of the nature and value of the
corrections.

VAT reporting::
Invoices/credit notes should provide support for the determination of the VAT regime and the calculation
and reporting thereof and should provide necessary elements for national legal VAT requirements that apply
for invoices/credit notes issued to national and foreign buyers.

Payment::
The invoice/credit note should identify the means of settlement,
and clearly state the requested payment.

Verification::
Support for invoice/credit note verification is a key function of an invoice/credit note. An invoice/credit note
should provide sufficient information for looking up relevant existing documentation, and should contain
information that allows the transfer of the received invoice/credit note to a responsible person or department
for verification and approval. For this purpose, an invoice/credit note should provide the following information:
* Preceding order.
* Contracts.
* Buyerâ€™s reference.
* Receipts of products and/or services.
* Identification of the responsible person or department.
* A credit note must refer to at least one initial invoice or credit note.
