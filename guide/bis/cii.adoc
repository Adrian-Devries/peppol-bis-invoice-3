= Cross Industry Invoice

This {peppol} BIS supports the *optional* use of the UN/CEFACT XML Cross Industry Invoice, D16B (CII).

All invoice instances expressed in CII must be compliant to the restrictions and rules made by this BIS, and hence a CII instance document, must be validated against the PEPPOL specific rules, just as the UBL instance documents.

The CII validation artefacts are not provided in this review, but will be developed to enforce the same restrictions as for UBL.

Specification identifier (BT-24) and business process type (BT-23) are the same in a CII instance as for the UBL instance, see <<prof-01>>
